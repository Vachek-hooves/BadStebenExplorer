Like many ancient German towns, Bad Steben is surrounded by legends and myths, creating a unique atmosphere and giving the place a special charm. According to local legend, long ago, on the site of present-day Bad Steben, there was nothing but wilderness and abandoned lands. However, one day, local hunters discovered a strange phenomenon: a hot spring gushing from the ground, surrounded by thick mist and unusually bright flowers not found elsewhere in the region. People began to believe that this place possessed healing properties, and soon pilgrims and those seeking healing started to gather here. Gradually, the first buildings were erected around the spring, and thus, the settlement that would become Bad Steben was born. Historical records confirm that the first mentions of Bad Steben date back to the 13th century. The town was founded around the healing springs, which attracted not only local residents but also people from distant regions. Thanks to its natural wealth, the settlement began to grow and develop rapidly. By the Middle Ages, Bad Steben had gained the status of a spa town, which ensured its continued prosperity. Today, Bad Steben preserves its historical heritage, proudly maintaining the memory of its foundation.

For example, during the Johannistag (St. John's Day) celebration, bonfires are traditionally lit around which people dance. This custom symbolizes protection from evil spirits and the attraction of good fortune for the coming year. In Bad Steben, old crafts such as woodworking, textiles, and ceramics are still practiced. These crafts are passed down from generation to generation and remain an important part of the town's cultural heritage. Annual craft fairs and folk art festivals offer the opportunity to learn more about these crafts and purchase unique handmade items. One of the region's most well-known customs is the harvest celebration. In the autumn, the town's residents organize fairs and street parties to celebrate a successful harvest. This custom is accompanied by traditional dishes and drinks, as well as songs and dances.",
